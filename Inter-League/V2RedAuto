//Version 1.0 coded Jan. 15, 2017 by Rylan and Marcus.  Designed to test the new autonomous concept
//of driving forward, shooting, turning to 45, finding the white line, turning to 90
//and then driving forward and pressing the beacon.  In version 1.0 we solely tested driving
//forward, turning to 45, finding the white line, and turning to 90, which was accomplished.
